<p>This page is a living snapshot of what has my attention right nowâ€”projects, experiments, and ideas in motion. Itâ€™s like an About page, but current. Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a>.</p>

<!-- Bismillah, I write to Remember

Hi, Iâ€™m Ken â€” a full-time front-end web developer and full-time stress manager for a home with four amazing kids (one ADHD-super-power son) and one incredible (and equally AuDHD-powered) wife.

This blog is a reminder to myselfâ€”and maybe to you tooâ€”that behind every hardship, there is ease. I share bits of family life, tips, and recommendationsâ€”hoping they help your day load faster and your steps run smoother.

May Allah ease your affairs. ðŸ¤² -->

## Current Focus

### Evolving from Full-Time Freelance to Indiepreneur

Iâ€™m working on the mindset, business structure, and product thinking needed to shift from doing client work full time toward building products with lasting value.

### Mining insights on <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieHackers</a>

Reading stories, trying experiments, and absorbing lessons from other indie makers. Their successes and failures are gold for figuring out what works.

### Learning from Starter Story

I enjoy watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@starterstory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarterStoryâ€™s YouTube channel</a>
â€” real-founder stories, tactical tips, and startup trajectories. Itâ€™s filling in gaps in my knowledge about growth, revenue models, and scaling. Their transparency helps me map out practical steps for growth and keeps my own ambitions grounded.

### Exploring Svelte

Iâ€™m experimenting with Svelte for new projects and trying to understand its unique reactive model, component design, and performance advantages. The goal isnâ€™t just to learn another framework, but to see if it can help me ship faster, leaner products.

## Also on My Desk

- Prototyping small microinteractions and UX details in side projects.
- Sketching a personal product roadmap toward a self-funded launch.
- Balancing code, design, and dad life in our neurodiverse household.
