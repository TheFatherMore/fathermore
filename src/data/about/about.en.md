<!-- Bismillah, I write to Remember

Hi, I’m Ken — a full-time front-end web developer and full-time stress manager for a home with four amazing kids (one ADHD-super-power son) and one incredible (and equally AuDHD-powered) wife.

This blog is a reminder to myself—and maybe to you too—that behind every hardship, there is ease. I share bits of family life, tips, and recommendations—hoping they help your day load faster and your steps run smoother.

May Allah ease your affairs. 🤲 -->

## Current Focus

### Switching from Full-Time Freelance to Indiepreneur

I’m working on the mindset, business structure, and product thinking needed to shift from doing client work full time toward building products with lasting value.

### Digging insights on <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieHackers</a>

Reading stories, trying experiments, and absorbing lessons from other indie makers. Their successes and failures are gold for figuring out what works.

### Learning from Starter Story

I enjoy watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@starterstory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarterStory’s YouTube channel</a>
— real-founder stories, tactical tips, and startup trajectories. It’s filling in gaps in my knowledge about growth, revenue models, and scaling. Their transparency helps me map out practical steps for growth and keeps my own ambitions grounded.

### Enjoy Playing Svelte

I’m experimenting with Svelte for new projects and trying to understand its unique reactive model, component design, and performance advantages. The goal isn’t just to learn another framework, but to see if it can help me ship faster, leaner products.

<!-- ## Also on My Desk

- Prototyping small microinteractions and UX details in side projects.
- Sketching a personal product roadmap toward a self-funded launch.
- Balancing code, design, and dad life in my neurodiverse household. -->
